1. Create a Java Class “Student” to manage a student. The class should have the attributes as follows:

name, id, address, dateOfBirth, admissionDate, cgpa, currentSemester, bloodGroup.

You are supposed to decide the data types of the attributes. The class also contains some methods. The methods are as follows:

setPersonalInfo(name, id, add, dateOfBirth, bloodGroup) ----- Assigns the value of the respective attributes.
setAcademicInfo(admDate, cgpa, currSem) ---- Assigns the value of the respective attributes.
showPersonalInfo()   — prints all Personal Information
showAcademicInfo() ----- prints all Academic Information
showtStudentInfo()  -- prints all (Personal and Academic) Information


The class should have a main method that will create several objects of Student class. Set and get Student information from this method. 

2. Create another class “Application” that will use the “Student” class to Set and get Student information.
